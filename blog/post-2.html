        Continuing with my project, I have created a figma prototype for the website that I'd like to create. I initially had the barebones design and now with the prototype, I was ready to move on. I started getting user feedback on layout and intuitiveness of the design. This enabled me to move forward with the work I had done thus far and solidify how I wanted the project to start coming along. I aim to have the small business website updated with the new look and hopefully begin working on processing transactions, starting with sample purchases and moving on from there.
