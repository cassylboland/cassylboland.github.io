        Starting my project journey, I decided upon creating a website for my small business. I chose this project because I wanted to learn how to build a website from scratch and have a platform to showcase my work. I began by researching different web development technologies and decided to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend. I set up my development environment and created a basic structure for my website, including a homepage, products page, contact page, and a specific product page(for individual items). I also started working on the design and layout of the site, aiming for a clean and modern look. Overall, it was an exciting start to my project, and I'm looking forward to making further progress in the coming weeks.
