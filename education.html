        I earned a Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Technology from Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas (May 2019). My coursework and clinical training emphasized anatomy and physiology, patient care, imaging procedures, documentation accuracy, and working efficiently in fast-paced environments. Alongside this background, I’ve built computer science skills through coursework and projects, including programming fundamentals and software development practices using languages and tools such as Python, C++, Java, SQL, and worked with project management tools like Git, and GitHub, as well as web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
